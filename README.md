- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JohnathanWayneHill

I teach and tutor programming online. These repositories are used for teaching or tools to make teaching easier (like my grade automation tool). Included are examples of uses for different tools, sample projects for students, samples of technical documentation from my previous work, and a grade automation tool that I am currently working on. Most repositories are "still in progress" because tools change and, therefore, the way I teach tools changes.

JohnathanWayneHill/JohnathanWayneHill is a âœ¨ special âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
You can click the Preview link to take a look at your changes.
